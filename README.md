# Social Media Mining
This notebook refers to a social media mining class I've taught at a Post-Grad Course.

Nowadays we live in a hyperconnected world. Where the physical society transposes almost perfectly to the cyberspace through interactions in Social Media. There we can see political debating, hatred discourse spread, thought bubbles, fake news, and much more. 
So in order to explore, and understand the social behavior, we can rely upon social media mining techniques to extract evidences of such behaviors throughout posts, profile information, and topological analysis of the social networks.

## In order to run the project do:
1. First create a folder called data here in the same project folder.

2. Run the `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install dependencies.

3. Use NLTK to download the portuguese corpus, so you will be able to filter stopwords.

4. Then, on terminal, run the `jupyter notebook` command.

5. Then execute all cells.
 
You will be able to get tweets and do basic analytics and a topology mapping for tweets exchange.
