# social_media_mining
This notebook refers to a social media mining class I've taught.

First create a folder called data here in the same project folder.

Then, on terminal, run the `jupyter notebook` command.
Then execute all cells.
 
You will be able to get tweets and do basic analytics and a topology mapping for tweets exchange.
